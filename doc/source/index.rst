Stochastic Gating for Feature Selection
========================================

Complete implementation of stochastic gating methods for feature selection in neural networks.

This library provides implementations of:
- **STG (Stochastic Gates)** - Original Gaussian-based method
- **STE (Straight-Through Estimator)** - Binary gates with gradient approximation
- **Gumbel-Softmax** - Categorical relaxation for feature gating
- **Correlated STG** - Extension for handling correlated features
- **L1 Regularization** - Baseline comparison method
